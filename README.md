# Oh My Posh Theme - bit10k 

This theme is meant to be a cross between the existing OMP theme [atomicBit](https://ohmypo.sh/docs/themes#atomicbit) (*at least from an inspirational standpoint*) and the popular [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) (*or at least, my customization of it, see screenshots below*). 

The theme is organized as follows: 

`````shell
<Block 1>																							<Block 2>
<Block 3>																							<Block 4>
<Block 5>																							<Block 6>
`````

## Block 1: User & Host Info

m 

## Block 2: Cloud Info

m 

## Block 3: OS, Git & Directory Info

m 

## Block 4: Language & Package Info

m 

## Block 5: Prompt

m 

## Block 6: Status & Time Info

m
